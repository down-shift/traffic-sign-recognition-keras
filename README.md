# traffic-sign-recognition-keras

This repository contains the code for a traffic sign recognition project.

The algorithm is based on **LeNet-5** architecture developed by Yann LeCun.

Dataset contains 8 kinds of traffic signs: 
- artificial roughness 
- give way
- movement prohibition
- no entry
- parking
- pedestrian crossing
- road works
- stop

The NN was trained on 10 epochs. The resulting accuracy of the model is **96%**.

The following libraries were used: Keras, TensorFlow, NumPy, OpenCV, Pillow, scikit-learn
